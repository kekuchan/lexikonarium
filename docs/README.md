# Overview

Lexikonarium is about creating dictionaries 
for self learning purposes. Learnt expressions 
with informations can be added, and quickly 
looked upon them, if found in some given text.

The name Lexikonarium is from the Greek lexiko,
and the Latin dictionarium, both meaning dictionary.

# Technical details 

Lexikonarium was designed to load a file, 
containing the dictionaries into the memory,
and using it directly for fast lookups. When 
only one dictionary is contained, it saves 
space by not having to keep referencing it. 
For editing however it has to be converted 
to an editable format. Thus it was designed 
for smaller dictionaries, otherwise a different 
architecture would be needed to read and write 
to them in smaller parts.

# Tutorial

To access the menu, tap or click the top "Menu" 
bar. Choose "Add/Find", and type "Greek" for the 
dictionary, "lexiko" for the expression and 
"dictionary" for the meaning, and choose "Add".
Add another by typing "Latin" for the dictionary,
"dictionarium" for the expression and "dictionary" 
for the meaning, and again choose "Add". Now we 
have two dictionaries ("Greek" and "Latin"), two 
expressions ("lexiko" and "dictionarium") and a
meaning ("dictionary"). To exit the menu, tap or 
click "Cancel", then "Cancel" again. Now by typing 
in the empty area right above the "Menu" button,
some text containing the words "lexiko" or 
"dictionarium", and then putting the cursor before 
the first letter of these words, their meaning is 
looked up and displayed above.

Save the dictionaries in the menu with "Save", 
choose a file system type like "idb://" (permanent 
storage in the browser, unless it gets cleared so be 
sure to make backups as detailed below). From now on, 
this tutorial will shorthand "idb://" as a leading 
"/" for simplicity purposes (though in the 
application it will still be written out fully). 
Tap or click "/", (or choose another path), 
"New file", type in some name ending with ".laf" 
(Lexikonarium archive file), choose "Create", 
tap or click on the created ".laf" file, and 
choose "Select". Optionally type in some comment, 
and choose "Save". Creating a backup as a 
safety measure is done with choosing the saved 
path, then the ".laf" file, and "Download". 
To exit the menu, tap or click "Cancel".

To load a saved ".laf" file, choose in the menu 
"Load", "/", tap or click on the ".laf" file 
(or upload a backup file before that by choosing the 
folder path and "Upload file"), then "Select" and 
"Load". This overwrites any of the currently used 
dictionaries, expressions and meanings with those 
in the ".laf" file. To exit the menu, tap or click 
"Cancel". If editing is needed, then the loaded 
".laf" file has to be converted in the menu with 
"Edit" and "Convert". To exit the menu, tap or 
click "Cancel".
